# Exercise 1

# R as a fancy calculator
# 1.1 what is 1+1
# 1.2 What is 3 times 17 ?
# 1.3 Create an object d equal to 10.
# 1.4 Divide d by 5.
# 1.5 Overwrite d, let it now be equal to 20, and print d, to see the results
# 1.6 Overwrite d (which is now 20) with 4 times d, and print d top see the result
# 1.7 Overwrite d (which is now 80), with d times d, and print the result
# 1.8 Create a new object A and set it equal to 3
# 1.9 Create another new object res, let it be the product of d and A, and output the result
# 1.10 Finally, take the average of d, A and res

# Exercise 1

#Use R to answer the following questions for you:
# 1.11 Is 4 greater than 2?
# 1.12 Is 5 less than 3?
# 1.13 Is 6.2 equal to 12.4/2?
# 1.14 Is 5 equal to or greater than 4? (hint:  use >=)
# 1.15 Is 5 equal to or less than 5? (hint:  use <=)
# 1.16 Is 7.5 equal to 137.25/18?
# 1.17 If m = 84 / 106 and q = 156/3; is m/q greater than, less than or equal to 0.0152?

## @knitr exercise_class

# Create a vector called 'odds' with the numbers 1,3,5,7,9.
# Show what class odds is.
# Evaluate which numbers in the odds vector are greater than 4.
# Create a vector called 'fail' containing 1,3,5,'seven',9.
# Show what class fail is. Why is this vector this class?
